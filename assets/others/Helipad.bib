	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In November 2011, University Hospital Southampton ({UHS}), now a major trauma centre, opened its onsite helipad, allowing patients to be brought to the emergency department ({ED}) directly by air ambulance. Prior to this, helicopters were required to land at a local playing field and the patient had to be transferred by land ambulance. This study aims to investigate the impact this change in practice has had on the flow of patients to the {ED}.
{METHODS}: The authors completed a retrospective case analysis of the first 100 patients brought directly to {UHS} by helicopter. Data were obtained from {ED} notes and helicopter provider databases. Analysis was conducted on the type of incident and appropriateness of referral. Incident locations were plotted geographically.
{RESULTS}: 100 patients arrived at {UHS} {ED} by helicopter between 17 November 2011 and 31 March 2012. Of these, 79 were primary helicopter emergency medical service ({HEMS}) missions and 21 were secondary transfers from other hospitals. Of the {HEMS} patients, 38 were likely to have been transported to another hospital, had there not been an onsite helipad at {UHS}. 29 passed another suitable receiving hospital en route and therefore may have come to {UHS} for speciality services.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The provision of an onsite, 24 h helipad facility at {UHS} has resulted in a significant number of patients being transported to the hospital by helicopter who might otherwise have attended an alternative hospital.},

	abstract = {Background: Reducing length of hospital stay ({LOS}) is a policy aim for many health care systems and is thought to indicate efficiency. Methods: A {MedLine} search was undertaken for articles relating to '‘{LOS}’, ‘early discharge’ or ‘patient discharge’ between 1983 and 1997 and a selective search was undertaken for material published before 1983. Results: Routine data showed that there were variations in {LOS} between countries, regions and hospitals. The trends in {LOS} showed a decrease over time in all regions. Research consistently fails to show an adverse effect on health outcomes of reducing {LOS}, but there may nevertheless be an ethical or moral minimum {LOS}. Two recent examples illustrate this. There has been an outcry at some ultrashort stays, for example ‘drive-through mastectomy’ and 'lunchtime abortion' and these are discussed in the review. Conclusions: There are a number of reasons for the perceived lack of relationship between {LOS} and health outcomes. Clearly reducing days of care at the low-intensity end of a hospital stay may not necessarily affect health outcomes. There is a case to be made for tailoring care more exactly to an Individual’s needs by looking at the actual components of care rather than the place of care - within or outside hospital walls.},

	abstract = {Surgical departments are increasingly put under pressure to improve services, cut waiting lists, increase efficiency and save money. At a district general hospital in the west-midlands we approached the challenge of improving efficiency and optimising the services available in our orthopaedic theatres.
Data was collected on: anaesthetic start times, operation start and finish times, and reasons for delay in our trauma theatre over a period from October 2014 to January 2015. During this period a change was implemented to improve the start time of the first operation of each day in the trauma theatre. Through adaptation of a method developed by Javed S et al, a patient was pre-selected by the on-call team and given the name the "golden patient" the day before they were due to be operated upon. This nominated patient would then be fixed at the start of the trauma theatre list the following day. The list would only then change if a "life or limb threatening" case was admitted overnight. The on-call team would prioritise that this patient was optimised for theatre and the theatre staff would ensure the surgical instruments were prepared.
A {PDSA} cycle method was used, collecting data on 80 orthopaedic trauma cases during the period, and demonstrated a 59 minute (95\% {CI} 45-72) improvement in start times from 10:49 {AM} to 9:50 {AM} with a p-value of 0.00024 with the intervention of early allocation of the first patient on the trauma list.
A relatively simple intervention tool designed to improve communication within and between health-care teams can have a significant impact on the efficiency of a complex environment such as a trauma theatre.},

	abstract = {To determine reasons for variations in length of stay ({LOS}) for surgical patients, a comprehensive statistical model was specified and estimated using 1978 discharge abstract data from New Jersey. The model distinguished preoperative {LOS} from postoperative {LOS}, and analyzed differences in the impacts of each determining factor on each segment of a hospital stay. The model included a large set of control variables, but the focus of discussion in this article is on factors which reflect the preferences, policies, and organizational routines of hospitals. The empirical findings suggest strategies that hospital managers and regulators can use for reducing average {LOS}. For example, afternoon admissions often result in extra preoperative days of care even after adjusting for severity of illness. Apparent scarcity of posthospital care in New Jersey also seems to translate into longer hospital stays. Using a comprehensive model and a large, reliable data set, the analysis confirms many hypotheses concerning reasons for {LOS} variation that have been suggested by earlier research. However, the analysis also raises questions concerning the interpretation of other earlier findings.},

	abstract = {Factors related to hospital resource use by intensive care unit ({ICU}) patients, including severity of illness at admission and intensity of therapy during the first 24 {ICU} hours were explored in this study. Analysis was based on 2,749 patients admitted to the general medical-surgical {ICU} at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Massachusetts, between February 1,1983 and January 10, 1985. Resource use was indexed by hospital length of stay ({LOS}) adjusted for differences between {ICU} and other hospital days. Severity of illness was measured by the Mortality Prediction Model ({MPM}0), a validated predictor of outcome but not previously used to analyze resource consumption. Intensity of therapy was measured using the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System ({TISS}). The 10\% of patients with longest {ICU} stays were significantly different from the other 90\% with respect to previous {ICU} use, {MPM} probability, and {TISS} score. Variability in resource use was analyzed using four diagnosis-related groups ({DRGs}) accounting for large numbers of {ICU} patients. The relationship between severity of illness and resource use was nonlinear: as severity increased from low levels, resource use increased at a decreasing rate, reached a plateau, and eventually declined. Within each {DRG}, {MPM}0 explained a statistically significant percentage of the variability in resource use., (C) Lippincott-Raven Publishers.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: To present an approach for assessing intensive care unit ({ICU}) performance which takes into account both economic and clinical performance while adjusting for severity of illness. To present a graphic display which permits comparisons among a group of hospitals.
{DESIGN}: A multicenter, inception cohort study.
{SETTING}: Twenty-five {ICUs} in U.S. hospitals that participated in the European and North American Study of Severity Systems for {ICU} Patients.
{PATIENTS}: Consecutive patients (n = 3,397) admitted to {ICUs} in participating hospitals between September 30, 1991 and December 27, 1991. Excluded were coronary care patients, burn patients, cardiac surgery patients and patients aged {\textless} 18 yrs.
{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: The clinical performance index is the difference between observed hospital survival rate and survival rate predicted by the Mortality Probability Model measuring severity of illness at {ICU} admission. The economic performance (resource use) measure is a length of stay index, Weighted Hospital Days, which weights {ICU} days more heavily than non-{ICU} days. The economic performance index is the difference between actual mean resource use and the resource use predicted by a regression including severity of illness and percent of surgical patients. Both the clinical and economic performance indices are standardized to show how far a particular hospital is from the overall mean and are graphed together. Most of the 25 hospitals lie within 1 {SD} of the mean on both clinical and economic performance scales. The graph makes it easy to identify those hospitals that are outside this range. There is no evidence of a trade-off between high clinical performance and high economic performance; i.e., it is possible to achieve both.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Cross-indexing of clinical and economic {ICU} performance is easy to calculate. It has potential as a research and evaluation tool used by physicians, hospital administrators, payers, and others.},

	doi = {10.1136/emj.2005.027045},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Helicopter air ambulance crews are influenced in their selection of the destination hospital for their patients by several factors including: distance from the scene; facilities, on site specialties, and senior cover of the receiving hospital; and the proximity of the helicopter landing area to the emergency department ({ED}). Only a limited number of hospitals have landing sites adjacent to the {ED} from which patients can be taken directly into the department (primary landing sites). Helicopter crews will often elect to over fly hospitals that do not have primary landing sites because secondary land transfers will add delays in delivering patients. Birmingham Heartlands Hospital has an elevated helideck adjacent to the {ED}. In October 2003, the Warwickshire and Northamptonshire Air Ambulance ({WNAA}) service was launched; the hospital sits on the western periphery of the area served by the service.
{METHODS}: Prospective data was collated on all patients brought by {WNAA} to Heartlands Hospital between 1 October 2003 and 31 August 2004.
{RESULTS}: In the 10 month period after the launch of the service, the helicopter delivered 83 patients to the {ED}; 74 of these were "off patch". This additional workload generated 163 ward days, 19 operative procedures, and 85 intensive care unit, high dependency unit, or coronary care unit days. The direct costs of this additional workload approached 160,000 pounds sterling.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In future discussions on the cost effectiveness of air ambulances, it will be important to consider both the direct and indirect costs to the receiving hospitals arising from the redistribution of emergency workload.},
