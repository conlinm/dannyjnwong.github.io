The Surgical Outcomes Research Centre (SOuRCe) collected perioperative data on almost 2,000 patients undergoing high-risk surgery. I used this to construct a [new model](http://dannyjnwong.github.io/Predicting-Postop-Morbidity-Elective-Surgical-Patients-using-SORT/) to predict postoperative morbidity as defined by the Post-Operative Morbidity Survey (POMS), based on the [Surgical Outcome Risk Tool](http://www.sortsurgery.com/).

This has now been [published](https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aex117) and I provide an online tool to calculate morbidity risks [here](https://dannyjnwong.shinyapps.io/SORTMorbidityWebCalc/).

Further work on the dataset is currently being undertaken to share it as anonymised open data in order to facilitate reproducible research and answer other research questions.
