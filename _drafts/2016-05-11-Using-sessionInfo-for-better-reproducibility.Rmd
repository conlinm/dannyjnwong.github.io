I've recently had some trouble with re-running some old code. It turns out that the error was that the package `ggplot2` had recently released a new version and that I had upgraded it without realising that it would alter how my old code functioned.

As a result, I will now include `sessionInfo()` at the end of every piece of work I do, so that when I compile my `.Rmd` file, I will know in the future what the versions of the packages I used were. This will hopefully improve the reproducibility of my code.

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
