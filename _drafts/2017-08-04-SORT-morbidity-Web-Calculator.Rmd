I have produced a new `R` Shiny implementation of the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aex117) I had published last month in the British Journal of Anaesthesia.

Go try it out [here](https://dannyjnwong.shinyapps.io/SORTMorbidityWebCalc/)! You can see the source code [here](https://github.com/dannyjnwong/SORTMorbidityWebCalc).

```{r}
