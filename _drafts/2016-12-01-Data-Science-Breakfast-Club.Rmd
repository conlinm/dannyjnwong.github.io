I am part of the [Data Science Breakfast Club](http://datascibc.org/) which meets every fortnight to chat about research, data science, statistics, and computer programming over a coffee, usually in and around UCL. 

Our group delivers the [Data Science for Doctors](http://datascibc.org/Data-Science-for-Docs/) course, which has taught the basics of data analysis using the `R` programming language to about 50 people over the last 2 years. We have written about our experiences in delivering the course [here](https://www.rcoa.ac.uk/system/files/Bulletin104.pdf) and [here](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2017-06-07-data-science-docs).
